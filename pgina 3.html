Robert Oppenheimer, often called the &ldquo;father of the atomic bomb,&rdquo; was a brilliant physicist whose work reshaped both science and world history. Born in 1904 in New York City, he excelled academically from an early age and later became a leading figure in quantum physics. His deep curiosity and ability to explain complex ideas made him a respected professor and researcher long before his involvement in wartime science. By the early 1940s, his expertise and leadership had placed him at the center of one of the most ambitious scientific projects ever attempted.</p></td>

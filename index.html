Robert Oppenheimer</strong> (1904–1967) was an American theoretical physicist best known as the scientific director of the <strong data-start="235" data-end="256">Manhattan Project</strong>, the U.S. government&rsquo;s top-secret World War II program that developed the first nuclear weapons.

          <p data-start="503" data-end="818">Born on April 22, 1904, in New York City to a wealthy, cultured family of German-Jewish immigrants, Oppenheimer showed early brilliance in science, languages, and literature. He attended the <strong data-start="694" data-end="720">Ethical Culture School</strong>, then studied chemistry and philosophy at <strong data-start="763" data-end="785">Harvard University</strong>, graduating in just three years.</p>
        <p data-start="820" data-end="1103">He later pursued physics in Europe, earning his doctorate at the <strong data-start="885" data-end="912">University of Göttingen</strong> under Max Born. During this period, he interacted with leading physicists of the era—including Niels Bohr, Paul Dirac, and Werner Heisenberg—helping shape his interests in quantum mechanics.</p></td>

He made important contributions to quantum field theory, astrophysics, and the theory of electron–positron pairs. His early theoretical work also anticipated the existence of what would later be understood as black holes.</p>

There he coordinated thousands of scientists working on an unprecedented task: designing a workable atomic bomb.</p>
          <p data-start="1777" data-end="2110">His leadership—intellectual, organizational, and diplomatic—was critical. On July 16, 1945, the project succeeded with the <strong data-start="1900" data-end="1916">Trinity Test</strong>, the world&rsquo;s first detonation of a nuclear device. Witnessing the explosion, Oppenheimer famously recalled a line from the <em data-start="2040" data-end="2055">Bhagavad Gita</em>:<br data-start="2056" data-end="2059">
